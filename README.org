* Eazy-Gnuplot 

Super Duper Doopa Booka Lispy Gnuplot library

+ Structure-less -- no CFFI, no CLOS, no STRUCTURE 
+ Just print the data to the =*standard-output*= inside =plot= function

** Usage

+ 1 =with-plots= and (at least) 1 =gp-setup= per output file

Basically any attributes can be set -- mighty =&allow-other-keys=.  There
would be no compatibility issue regarding future/past changes in different
gnuplot versions.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-plots (*standard-output* :debug t) ; when 
      (gp-setup :xlabel "x-label"       ; strings are "quoted"
                :ylabel "y-label"
                :output path            ; pathnames are "quoted"
                :terminal :pdf          ; keyword/symbols are not quoted
                                        ; (but not escaped)
                :key '(:bottom :right :font "Times New Roman, 6")
                ;; lists contents are recursively quoted
                ;; then joined by a space
                :pointsize "0.4px")
      (plot (lambda ()
              (format t "~&0 0")
              (format t "~&1 1"))
            :using '(1 2)
            :title "1"
            :with '(:linespoint))
      (plot (lambda ()
              (format t "~&0 1")
              (format t "~&1 0"))
            :using '(1 2)
            :title "2"
            :with '(:lines)))
#+END_SRC

This produces the following gnuplot code internally (when :debug is non-nil,
it is also output to =*trace-output*= via =broadcast-stream=). It will then
be fed to gnuplot interpreter.

#+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot
set xlabel "x-label"
set ylabel "y-label"
set output "/mnt/video/guicho/repos/lisp/eazy-gnuplot/sample.pdf"
set terminal pdf
set key bottom right font "Times New Roman, 6"
set pointsize "0.4px"
plot '-' using 1:2 title "1" with linespoint, '-' using 1:2 title "2" with lines
0 0
1 1
end
0 1
1 0
end
#+END_SRC
